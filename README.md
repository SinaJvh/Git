# Git
## Repository 
is that container for our source control, it’s place that we put all of our files (Repository means place to store stuff) and it’s also for changes, the history, who changed it, the various version of our files

## Init
short for initialize - it’s set up tracking, initial state of the repository and so on. به همین ترتیب

## Clone 
it takes the entire repository setup with all history, changes, everything. So it makes a duplicate of everything and I start working locally
